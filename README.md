# VitaWebTools
The successor to QuickLinks (https://api.vita.meek.moe/QuickLinks)

Cleaned up code and made a bit more pretty

This uses a few things that didnt have nuget packages (or are just native executables):
[SFO.Net](https://github.com/KuromeSan/Sfo.NET)
[psvimgtools](https://github.com/yifanlu/psvimgtools)
Also used someparts of [Chovy Sign](https://github.com/KuromeSan/chovy-sign)
