# VitaWebTools
The successor to QuickLinks (https://api.vita.meek.moe/QuickLinks)  

This is now at https://vita.sekoree.dev

Cleaned up code and made a bit more pretty  

This uses a few things that didnt have nuget packages (or are just native executables):  
[SFO.Net](https://github.com/KuromeSan/Sfo.NET)  
[psvimgtools](https://github.com/yifanlu/psvimgtools)  
Also used some parts of [Chovy Sign](https://github.com/KuromeSan/chovy-sign)
