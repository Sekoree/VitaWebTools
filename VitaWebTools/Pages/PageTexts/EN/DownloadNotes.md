Put all folders from the archive (.zip) file into the folder you've set in QCMA for Backups with you AID.

By default that should be:
- Windows: `Documents\PS Vita\APP\{0}\`
- macOS: `"Home"/PSVita/APP/{0}/` or `<YourUsername>/PSVita/APP/{0}/`
- Linux: `/home/<YourUsername>/PSVita/APP/{0}/`

After that either restart QCMA or right-click on the small Vita icon in your Taskbar (or left-click on it on non-Windows OSs) and select "Refresh Database".
